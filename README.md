                                                 Notes to graders
                                         
I want graders not to be misled by the name of the folders network and project4.I used those names because I want to use the configurations of project4 like settings.py,wsgi.py....,but thier content is totally unrelated to project4 and they contain my final project.My pc stops recording video when I change the size of the screen,so i couldn't show when my webpage work on smaller screen on the same video. Here is a link to a short video that shows when the page works on smaller screen https://youtu.be/cBn8LQey4ho


I have a folders called books ,network and project4. Books folder is used to save uploaded files. Network folder contains the main programming of my final project, and project4 folder contains configurations of the project. Here is some brief about the pages:
 
Sign up/sign in: Users will sign up as student, teacher or admin, and see different pages based on their job. Students will choose their interests and teachers their subject. After they once signed up, they login using their username and password.

Student’s page: Students see courses based on their interests they choose when they signed up. Courses are ordered based on their interest. I.e. courses on their first chosen interest will be at top, courses on second interest will be next…. They could also search for courses and if not available, message will be sent to admins to notify that there is not the course searched. They could also give comments to the admin in this page.

Course page: clicking a course among the list will take students to a page where they could see details of the course and register to the course. After they registered, clicking the course will take them to a page where they would see all materials/readings of the course. They could also give comments about the course in this page.

Teacher’s page: The teacher will be able to write materials/readings. He/she will see list of students registered to his/her course, comments given by students, upload files to students. He/she could also write comments to the admin.

Admin’s page: admin will see comments given by students, teachers and clicking on a button will search for any new category of courses and will add it as option for students to select it as interest.

                                 Complexity and distinctiveness
I believe that the project is distinct, as the course has not such like project related to coordinating teaching-learning process with students, teachers and admins having different pages. It is complex because users will register differently and see different pages based on their job. In addition, the project has many relations like which students are registered to a course, which teachers give which course, comments to a teacher, comments to admin by students and teachers. It encompasses many aspects unlike previous projects where a very specific aspect is handled. In other words, It is a platform where schools could use to handle their work completely whereas with the previous projects organizations could handle a little part of their work, may be messages between workers only.
